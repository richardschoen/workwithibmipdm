# Work with IBM i - Productivity Development Manager for Windows (PDM)
This will be the distribution and support site for the Work with IBM i client. 

The purpose of Work with IBM i is to provide a usable Windows based replacement for PDM on the 5250 green screen.

The Work with IBM i client also provides a direct interface to the iForGit source management commands for commiting changes to your git repositories from your standard source physical files. Use of these commands assumes you have an iForGit license. Learn more here: http://www.iforgit.com

You can also use any Windows editor of choice to edit source file content: including Notepad, Notepad++, VS Code, RDI, etc.

PDM user options are also supported as long as they don't expect to interface with a 5250 interface.

**Please submit feedback as issues on the GitHub issues tab.**

Note: If you use Work with IBM i to download and edit source members, line numbers and source dates are NOT preserved. 
We're assuming you're stepping in to the new world of using PCs to edit your source members
