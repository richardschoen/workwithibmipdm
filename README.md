# Work with IBM i - Productivity Development Manager for Windows (PDM)
This will be the distribution and support site for the Work with IBM i client. 

The purpose of Work with IBM i is to provide a usable ```Windows based replacement for PDM``` on the 5250 green screen to work with IBM i source members.

You can use any Windows based editor of choice to edit source file content: including Notepad, Notepad++, VS Code, RDI, etc. Notepad.exe is the default setting for the viewer and editor. You can use a separate editor and viewer if desired. 

PDM user options are also supported as long as they don't expect to interface with a 5250 interface. The PDM options file setting defaults to: ```QGPL/QAUOOPT``` and can be changed in the settings file.

The Work with IBM i client also provides a direct interface to the ```iForGit source management``` commands for commiting changes to your git repositories from your standard source physical files. Use of these commands assumes you have an iForGit annual subscription license. Learn more here: http://www.iforgit.com

Note: If you use Work with IBM i to download and edit source members, line numbers and source dates are NOT preserved. 
We're assuming you're stepping in to the new world of using PCs to edit your source members
