# Using RDI for Editing Local Files
Unfortunately so far I have not been able to find a way to just tell RDI to launch an individual local file by name. This seems to be a limitation of the RDI.EXE or Eclipse editor configuration.

## Partial workaround
- Make a local filter in RDI to directory: C:\tmp_workwithibmi\<systemname>.  (Or whatever level you want)

- Then you can use "Work with IBMi" to download and upload files but you can edit them from the local system connection filter you create in RDI.
